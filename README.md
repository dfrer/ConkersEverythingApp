# Personal Everything App

This repository contains the initial foundation for a personal "Everything App". The app aims to unify many day–to–day tasks such as note taking, timers and basic integrations with services like YouTube, Gmail and Twitter.

## Features

- **Deep customization** via a JSON configuration file.
- **Notes module** for quick text notes.
- **Timers module** for simple countdown timers.
- **Orders module** placeholder for future ordering features.
- **Integrations** with YouTube, Gmail and Twitter (currently placeholders).

## Running

The project requires Python 3. Run the CLI using:

```bash
python -m everything_app.main
```

Commands available in the demo:

- `notes` &mdash; add a note.
- `timer` &mdash; start a timer in seconds.
- `exit` &mdash; quit the app.

Feel free to extend the modules and integrations to suit your personal workflow.
